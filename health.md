<p>Health is the chief cornerstone that we build the rest of our lives and experiences upon. Without health our time and attention is so distracted we are nearly unable to participate in or enjoy anything else.
<p>Health is the first cornerstone for designing a life that goes far beyond the stars. Think about it: You can enjoy a sunset, delicious desert or meditative state just as much as Bill Gates or Warren Buffett.
<p>Yet nothing will impinge on your time and attention plus your ability to learn and accomplish things as much as poor health.
<p>Consequently, health in all its facets, physical, mental, emotional and spiritual, is the first cornerstone for being able to design your life.
