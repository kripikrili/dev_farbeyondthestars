title: The Facebook Exodus and the Future of Human Communication

<p><em>Boulder, CO. January 26th 2011. </em></p>
<p>I left (deactivated) <strong>Facebook</strong> with the intention of never returning a few days ago. I thought I’d share a few thoughts on why here on the public blog.</p>
<p>Many of the smartest people I know are leaving <strong>Facebook</strong> as well. I predict we’ll see many people leaving over the coming months and adopting Twitter.</p>
<p>For around a year I’ve been using Twitter as my primary way to communicate with most of the important people in my life.</p>
<p>I believe that Twitter is a new form of <strong>communication</strong> so important that it rivals the development of language in the evolutionary history of the <strong>human</strong> race.</p>
<p>In a few hundred years historians (or our immortal digital selves for  that matter) will look back at this day and say “wow, Twitter really  changed a lot of things for the people who used it. It’s too bad so many  people stuck with <strong>Facebook</strong> because they were brainwashed into clicking “Like” on photos of hot girls/boys they’ll never sleep with all night long.”</p>
<p>Today, let’s just focus on why I left <strong>Facebook</strong>, and why you should too!</p>
<p><strong>1. The purpose of the Internet is to facilitate face to face <strong>communication</strong></strong>.</p>
<p>I’m beginning to see the Internet as a tool to bring people together,  so they can communicate 1 to 1 in order to exchange knowledge in a  high-definition way. I’ve noticed that I learn the best these days when I  meet brilliant minds to meld with, in person. <strong>Facebook</strong> wasn’t facilitating this for me, it was simply becoming a black hole where plans are made but never acted upon.</p>
<p>Twitter does bring people together. The only reason I’m staying in Boulder CO at the moment and speaking on May 21st 2011 at <a href="http://thisismindful.com/">This is Mindful</a> in Melbourne Australia is because of real world interactions via Twitter.</p>
<p>These days I can tweet in any city, or to any city, and things happen  such as tweetups or missions dedicated to saving the world. If I need a  place to stay, why not just Tweet? Easy. Yes, it takes time to develop a  Twitter network large enough to facilitate this kind of massive  collective interaction, but it is possible.</p>
<p><strong>2. Accelerated cultural evolution.</strong></p>
<p>Over time Twitter develops into convergent collectives of idea innovators and executors. <a href="http://twitter.com/rosshill">@rosshill</a> is a big advocate and designer of these collectives. Essentially, your  education begins to accelerate due to natural group interactions on  Twitter. I’ll tweet an idea while <a href="http://www.twitter.com/edwardharren">@edwardharren</a> <a href="http://www.twitter.com/janstewart">@janstewart</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/davidahood">@davidahood</a> are asleep in Melbourne, and they’ll further the idea while I’m asleep  in Boulder. Over Twitter we exchange ideas, articles, and books that are  necessary for the work that interests us, thus we grow together.</p>
<p>This is exponential education — I’m an idea-growth addict these days.</p>
<p>If someone in the collective isn’t resonating with me, I simply  unfollow. If I stumble across someone who is resonating, I follow. It’s a  fluid collective with no obligations or contracts. Don’t worry if I  unfollow you, I might just come back later! It all has to do with where  my mind is focused on the work.</p>
<p>Twitter collectives begin to develop their own languages and insider knowledge. with Twitter can even start learning how to <a href="http://janstewart.com.au/ibc">#ibc</a>, which is a pretty extraordinary intuitive skill to master.</p>
<p><strong>3. Attention is a currency.</strong></p>
<p>We’re in a full-scale war on Internet noise, and <strong>Facebook</strong> isn’t helping. Facebook’s purpose is to bring you back again and again  to see ads, this means the software is designed to play on your <strong>human</strong> desires in order to make you return to the software multiple times a day.</p>
<p>The noise on the Internet will only grow over the next few months, and our <strong>human</strong> minds can’t deal with it. <strong>Facebook</strong> isn’t helping with the noise, instead it’s adding to it.</p>
<p>Where Twitter retweets and @messages feel like an epic win in the gameification of reality, <strong>Facebook</strong> “Likes” feel like an epic win for Mark Zuckerberg. Why? Because every time someone hits the “Like” button on your <strong>Facebook</strong> page, it draws you back into <strong>Facebook</strong> so you can see another advertisement. Cash-money for <strong>Facebook</strong>.</p>
<p>You can’t trade your ‘Like’ wealth (the amount of times that someone  has clicked ‘Like’ on your status update or photo) for real cash –<strong>Facebook</strong> can and does. Shouldn’t <strong>Facebook</strong> be paying you to spend all of your time on their site?</p>
<p><strong>4. We need to create and own our virtual reality worlds.</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.gwenbell.com/">Gwen</a> pointed me in the direction of this <a href="http://www.aiga.org/content.cfm/video-gain-2010-harris">beautiful talk by Jonathan Harris</a> about the reality of the Internet today. I want to make out with him  (we can invite Gwen too) after the talk, you will too after you watch  it.</p>
<p>Jonathan is beginning to see two Internets. One of these internets is  filled with condominiums that all look alike, with your own pictures on  the walls. These condos are easy, and free. Your great aunt can set one  of these <strong>Facebook</strong> condos up — so easy.</p>
<p>The other Internet is the one where we build our own beautiful  virtual worlds. This blog for example exists in a world that I have  control over — it wouldn’t be the same or have any power if I hosted the  content on <strong>Facebook</strong> or another condo-like housing situation.</p>
<p>The problem with renting a free internet condo (ahem, <strong>Facebook</strong>)  is that someone else has control of your virtual world. So, the default  for a generation of new Internet users has been to go the easy route.</p>
<p>The thing is, the easy route isn’t going to create you a second self  that supports your life in the real world, it’s just going to keep you  in a place where you’re interacting with the noise.</p>
<p>The farther we get away from letting someone else control our virtual  world, the easier it is to find success in a world filled with  overwhelming digital noise. This is why you find all of the successful  digital people on Twitter, and hordes of people caught up in the noise  on <strong>Facebook</strong> wondering why nothing is working for them.</p>
<p>–</p>
<p>Leaving <strong>Facebook</strong> is hard. It’s a part of your 3rd brain, the part of your mind that’s  situated in the cloud. It’s important to build a Twitter presence first,  and then slowly transition away from <strong>Facebook</strong>. To avoid losing all of your ambient intimacy at once, move slowly and with intention from <strong>Facebook</strong> to Twitter.</p>
<p>Here’s how to join us in our Twitter revolution. It’s a leap of faith, I’ll see you on the other side.</p>
<p>Twitter quick start guide:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/signup">Sign up for an account</a> using your name.</li>
<li>Put a picture of your face. (No, not your hand, your face. No, not your kitten, your face.)</li>
<li>Don’t follow celebrities or organizations (for the most part.)</li>
<li>Follow real humans and cyborgs. A good list to get started is my follow list — every one of these people is a freakin’ brilliant revolutionary.</li>
<li>Follow less than 150 people. 50 is ideal. Rotate the list based on resonation and intuition.</li>
<li>Retweet links that you like. Say things that are awesome. Send positive energy into the world. Try unexpected things.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s make the leap into a world where we have control of our virtual worlds.</p>
