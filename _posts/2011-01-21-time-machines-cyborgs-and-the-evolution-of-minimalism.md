title: Time Machines, Cyborgs, and the Evolution of Minimalism

_January 21st 2011. Boulder, CO. _

I love Mars Dorian, and I laughed when he said [“What kind of pills did you
slip into your muesli?”](http://www.marsdorian.com/2011/01/digital-persona/)
the other day when we were Skyping. While Mars and I aren’t exactly
#ibcing yet, after the in-person Skype chat we
were way closer to being on the same page.

It’s true, Far Beyond The Stars lately has been kind of well, far beyond the
stars.

The content here has been what we meditators like to call delving deep. It’s a
brief glance into the **future** which is now for a few of us — I’m a
timelord, you’re stepping into my Tardis when you’re with me in this space.

[Gwen](http://www.gwenbell.com/) and I have been talking a lot lately about
how we wish the Internet was more 4-dimensional. It needs the intelligence to
spot a person who’s at the point in their lives where they really need a
5-ways to declutter your desk post and give it to them, instead of a deep
philosophical piece on assimilating other **cyborgs** into the collective.

The truth is that my work moves, it changes, it evolves. Your work does and
will too.

Unfortunately I can’t write simple posts about ultra-light travel anymore. If
you want a great collection of those, The Art of Being
Minimalist really sums up how to go minimalist from the human perspective (though cyborg eyes will glaze over at
this point when they read the content that I wrote a year ago.)

My physical/mental/spiritual body has been evolving, it’s tapped into the
exponential nature of technology, and so my cultural evolution is tethered to
the rate of computer chip evolution. This evolution is quickly closing on
something like a million to the power of a million times better than it was
every year, just wait until we get exponentially accelerating quantum computer
chips.

**Minimalism** was assimilated by the **cyborgs**.

This didn’t happen because **cyborgs** wanted to become minimalists, it’s
because we the **cyborgs** didn’t know who we were when we became minimalists.

For eons humans only made physical tools, then all of a sudden we began to
develop mental tools. This much is clear from Amber Case’s brilliant Ted
Talk that you all should have watched by now.

**Cyborgs** are simply humans who made the shift from physical tools to mental tools. Eventually there will be enough **cyborgs** that we can call them humans again, and we’ll call people who still use physical tools something else.

When you develop mental tools, in a very short **time** you begin to realize
that you don’t need your physical possessions anymore, so you kind of just let
them go — it doesn’t hurt anymore. I saw this happen within a few weeks to
[Maren Kate](http://www.escapingthe9to5.com/) after she went location
independent when [Zirtual](http://zirtual.com/) was accepted into an incubator
program in Palo Alto. She instantly shifted from physical tools to mental
tools. Welcome to cyborgia Maren.

This doesn’t mean that **minimalism** never existed, just that there is much
more depth under the idea that many of us previously imagined. I predict that
a lot of minimalist websites in the next year (actually, probably a lot faster
than that) will fold or move on to deeper topics as our own evolution
progresses towards the **future**.

If you’re a minimalist blogger, it might be wise to quickly snag a URL that
isn’t ‘minimalist-X’ before everyone evolves exponentially past what you’re
writing about. However, be mindful of what your readers need. Mine need
**cyborgs** right now, your readers might be in a different place than mine
are.
