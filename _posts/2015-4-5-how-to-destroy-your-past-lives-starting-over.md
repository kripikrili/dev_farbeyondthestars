<p><em>“The hydrogen atoms in a human body completely refresh every  seven years. As we age we are really a river of cosmically old atoms.  The carbons in our bodies were produced in the dust of a star. The bulk  of matter in our hands, skin, eyes, and hearts was made near the  beginning of time, billions of years ago. We are much older than we  look.” – </em>Kevin Kelly, from his new book <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0670022152?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=farbeythestam-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0670022152">What Technology Wants</a>.</em></p>
<p>I  like the idea that every seven years we’re a totally new person. A  whole new set of hydrogen atoms, a whole new reason to reinvent  ourselves. Obviously this whole new person is defined somewhat by the  grand design of our DNA structure, and the choices we make, but it still  is a whole new body at it’s basic structural level.</p>
<p>For example, the me who ate bacon egg and cheeses every morning and  while sitting at a desk and eventually developed a 34 inch waist line 3  years ago is very different from the me now — with a 29 inch waist line,  who eats mostly fruit, veggies, coffee and the amazing food at <a href="http://www.thesummit-sf.com/">The Summit SF</a>, while taking double or triple yoga classes a day.</p>
<p><strong>Frequently we find ourselves dwelling on the <strong>past</strong>.</strong></p>
<p>We remember the night we said goodbye to the little blond girl in the  rain that one night in Manhattan. We remember the time we danced all  night until the sun came out in the basement of a school in Brooklyn. We  remember the time that we took that first photo of the first day we got  dropped off in New York. We remember the time we rode our bike to Lake  Michigan at 4am and watched the sun come up <strong>over</strong> the horizon.</p>
<p>These were all beautiful moments, but they happened in the <strong>past</strong>. In many ways they happened a lifetime ago.</p>
<p>There’s a reason that so many spiritual and philosophical practices<strong> focus on bringing you into the present moment, <strong>your</strong> breath, <strong>your</strong> heartbeat.</strong> Because these two things can only happen now, not then, not in the future.</p>
<p>Many of the people who contact me about becoming minimalist are struggling with a <strong>past</strong> that they cannot forgive or forget. So they hold on. They hold onto the  rocks they collected in 7th grade. They hold onto the memories of the  loves they never really had. They hold onto the art they created five  years ago, but never sold. They hold, hold, hold.</p>
<p>And these collections of memories, physical or emotional build up <strong>over</strong> time. These people become heavier and heavier, until they find no rest.  They do this until all of their energy is dedicated towards keeping the  <strong>past</strong> alive.</p>
<p><strong>The reality is that the <strong>past</strong> is dead. It happened, it shaped who you are, but it’s gone now.</strong></p>
<p>And it’s never coming back.</p>
<p>No matter how many Facebook messages you send to <strong>your</strong> high school ex-girlfriend/boyfriend when you’re drunk at night, you’re  never going to be 17 again. You’re never going to share the connection  you had then.</p>
<p>No matter how many times you look at that picture of the perfect  halloween, with the displaced tribe of a dozen remarkable individuals,  they’ll never be together again in the same way.</p>
<p>And this is okay. The world changes. <strong>We evolve into new and better individuals every single day.</strong></p>
<p>The choice though is this: will you continue to build up <strong>your</strong> energy in order to focus on the person you were back then?</p>
<p>Or can you let it go, to concentrate on the faces around you now?</p>
<p>Can you look up into the eyes of the person across from you at the  table at the coffee shop, or on the yoga mat next to you, or on the  other side of that email and say:</p>
<p>“I am here with you now.”</p>
<p>Because, you are.</p>
<p>Here are a few actions that I’ve taken to clear the <strong>past</strong>, maybe they can help you.</p>
<p><strong>1. <strong>Destroy</strong> <strong>your</strong> old unpublished work.</strong></p>
<p>In the last few years I’ve adopted an incredibly healthy habit of  burning Moleskin notebooks. When I’ve finished one, I take it somewhere  like the edge of a body of water or the top of a mountain and a burn it.  I like to think this releases the creative energy invested in the work  into the universe, so that it can come back to me or others at a later  date.</p>
<p>I’ve been writing a non-fiction story, a dialog between a young woman  and man who survive the apocalypse and then go on to save the world, in  notebooks for the last few years. Every time I finish a notebook, I  burn it, then start writing the story again. Every time I write the  story again it’s clearer, more focused, more important. Someday maybe  I’ll actually write a version that I want to publish, or maybe it’s just  an exercise to bring me closer to the creative side of my brain, who  knows?</p>
<p>This also means I can’t grab a notebook and flip back to remind  myself about how I felt about some girl I was in love with five years  ago when I feel down at 3am on a Tuesday night. I can still feel down,  but without the physical connection to the memory it’s that much harder  to escape to the <strong>past</strong>.</p>
<p>I’ve been thinking about taking all of the photos/data on my hard  drives collected from the dawn of time and destroying them too. I’ll let  you know if/when I do how that feels. I never look at this stuff, why  keep it?</p>
<p><strong>2. Don’t collect souvenirs.</strong></p>
<p>It might be obvious from the fact that I live with around 50 things  that I don’t collect stuff from places. I don’t have any artifacts to  remind me of my trip to Vietnam. I didn’t buy a I Heart NY shirt on the  day I left NY. I don’t save sea shells.</p>
<p>If I feel like I need to be connected to an awesome experience, I go out into the world and have one.</p>
<p><strong>3. I lose touch with (most) old friends.</strong></p>
<p>There are certain people who I have a cosmic connection with, who I  will continue to visit every time I wander through the city that they  live in. We’ll go to each others weddings, we’ll say each others  eulogies, we’ll make dinner together every time we cross paths.</p>
<p>My friends who are these people know who they are, and I know who  they are. We just know, there’s no other way of explaining why.</p>
<p>But most people aren’t those people. <strong>Over</strong> the last year I’ve met thousands of people, I’ve received tens of  thousands of emails. I’ve said ‘until next time’ to hundreds at the end  of the night. Most of these people I’ll never actively seek out again,  in essence, we’ll lose touch.</p>
<p>This sounds sad, but it isn’t. The fact is that most people aren’t <strong>your</strong> people. They’re just bodies passing in space and time. They might have  something to teach you in the moment, but after that moment they don’t  need <strong>your</strong> help anymore.</p>
<p>So you let them go.</p>
<p><strong>Why we need to <strong>destroy</strong> our <strong>past</strong> <strong>lives</strong>.</strong></p>
<p>The world is speeding up. 100 years ago, you’d probably have the same small group of friends who supported each other for <strong>your</strong> entire life. You never left the town you were born in. In order to get  in touch you had to send a postcard via the, uhm, snail mail? Whatever  that is.</p>
<p>In today’s world, it’s not uncommon to live many different <strong>lives</strong> <strong>over</strong> the course of <strong>your</strong> own. You’ll morph, change, <strong>your</strong> life will transition. You’ll move dozens or hundreds of times as the ever-growing cloud of connected information cares for <strong>your</strong> survival.</p>
<p>You have a choice, you can either let the pain and joys of the <strong>past</strong> build up until they’re too heavy a burden. Or, you can let everything go. Burn <strong>your</strong> notebooks, let the friends go, leave the souvenirs at the shop.</p>
<p>All that really matters is having a connection with the here and now. This breath, this movement, this heart beat.</p>
<p>What can you do to bring yourself here right now?
