title: What is Minimalist Workday? - Far Beyond The Stars
published: true
---

I’ve been tossing around the idea that our average workday is too long for awhile now.
<p>
Over the past year I’ve managed to build a business working an average of 2 hours a week. I’m not saying this to brag, but simply to let you know that it’s possible.
<p>
When you make slight behavioral modifications like turning off e-mail and focusing on what is important for your business, it’s amazing what you can accomplish.
<p>
Minimalist Workday outlines 50 strategies that I use to keep my workday at a comfortable 2 hours a day instead of the <a href="http://www.runtogold.com/fourhourworkweekbook" title="Great book on productivity." target="_blank">The 4-Hour Work Week</a> that Tim Ferris writes about. This way I can dedicate more time to research, travel, self-improvement, cooking good food, yoga, and helping others.
<p>
This started as a blog post, but spiraled out of control. The e-book is around 5,000 words, over the course of 30 pages. I hope that it helps you.
<p>
<h2>Why is Minimalist Workday free?</h2>
<p>
To be honest, I probably could have charged for this information, but then it wouldn’t help as many people. I’ve already doubled my income over the last year, and while more money is always better, some ideas need to be free to have the largest impact.
<p>
Minimalist Workday isn’t for everyone.
<p>
To be honest, I wrote this specifically with self-employed professionals who are running simple one-person businesses in mind. It really is a free addition to Minimalist Business.
<p>
That being said, with a little mental tweaking, I imagine you can apply this knowledge to a 9-5 in order to free up more time for launching extra-income earning side-projects or get yourself promoted. If you’re part of a ROWE company, even better.

If that looks bad on your Kindle, try this version (thanks @jprichter.)

What can you do to help?
<p>
If you enjoy this e-book, I’d really love if you could share it freely with as many people as you can.

<ul><li>Retweet this post to your Twitter friends</li>

<p>Etc, etc, any way that you can help would be great. Ideas can’t spread without your help.
<p>Thanks for your time, and for your help sharing this with the world.
