title: Don’t Listen to Anyone - Far Beyond The Stars
---

Many people I meet have a story about someone they know who failed.

People love to tell me these stories.

Maybe you’ve heard them too?

There’s the one about the girl who moved across the country and couldn’t find
a job and ‘now it’s so hard for her’.

Or that one boy who decided he was going to be a musician and went to New York
and he works retail and ‘it’s so hard for him’.

Everyone knows someone like this. They keep this person’s story ready to go,
and take aim at your dreams with him or her as evidence. ‘Look at this person,
they couldn’t do it, you can’t either’.

Then there’s the story about some mythical creature that ‘puts in the long
hours for their company, and now they’re set for life.’

No one seems to know anyone like this, and yet they’re all so sure this is a
reality.

Where are these ‘set for life’ people? I want to meet one please. Have one of
them send me a post card.

Everyone I know who is doing well right now has their own established
remarkable reputation.

The most common variety of person I encounter is settled for life. They gave
up long ago, and now they drag out that story every time I tell them I’m
moving again to pre-prove that I can’t do it …again.

Here’s my view of reality: you can do anything you want to, as long as you’re
willing to sacrifice your ability to undermine yourself.

There are no failures, only the people who choose to use other brave people as
defense against their own settled mediocrity.

Don’t listen to anyone’s fail stories. They just keep them in their back
pocket to defend their decision to be scared, to stay put, to not change.

You can move anywhere and do anything if you’re willing to trade secure
normality for knowing that you’re doing something awesome.

Where are you going next year?
