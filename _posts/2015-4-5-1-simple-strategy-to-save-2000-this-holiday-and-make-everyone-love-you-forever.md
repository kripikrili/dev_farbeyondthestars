<p>This post is going to go viral, so if <strong>you</strong>’re here for the first time let me introduce myself to those of <strong>you</strong> who are new.</p>
<p><strong>My name is Everett Bogue, and I think <strong>you</strong>’re an idiot.</strong></p>
<p>Why? Because <strong>you</strong> think that buying people things for Christmas will <strong>make</strong> them <strong>love</strong> <strong>you</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>You</strong> think this for a lot of reasons, here are a few of them.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>You</strong>’ve been giving and getting presents at Christmas since the dawn of time. It must be right, right?</li>
<li><strong>You</strong> watched TV and saw all of the happy faces around the Christmas tree in  the Coca Cola commercials, in the car commercials, in the clothing  commercials. Going to to the mall to buy things for people must be what  Christmas is all about, right?</li>
<li><strong>You</strong> haven’t followed up as to where the stuff that <strong>you</strong> bought <strong>everyone</strong> for Christmas actually ended up by the time New Years came around (hint: the closet, where no one has to look at what <strong>you</strong> gave them.)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Why your reality is broken.</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>simple</strong> fact is that your mind has been manipulated by mega-corporations into the mess that it is now. <strong>You</strong>’ve been bombarded by advertising since the day <strong>you</strong> were born telling <strong>you</strong> that the only way Christmas would be a success was if <strong>you</strong> spent somewhere around $1,000 on gifts for people.</p>
<p>Gallup estimates the average American <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/144506/November-Christmas-Spending-Estimate-Outpaces-2009.aspx">will spend $714 on Christmas gifts</a> that no one actually needs this year. If <strong>you</strong> hadn’t read this post, <strong>you</strong> probably would have spent way more. There’s no need to thank me yet, keep reading.</p>
<p>What they didn’t tell <strong>you</strong> about Christmas-gift-giving is that no one actually cares anymore. They don’t want the stuff <strong>you</strong>’re buying them. In fact, <strong>everyone</strong> <strong>you</strong> give gifts to is trying to recycle them, donate them, or stuff them in their attic as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Think about it this way: when was the last time <strong>you</strong> got something for Christmas that <strong>you</strong> really wanted?</p>
<p>I’m waiting… still nothing? Exactly.</p>
<p>If <strong>you</strong> didn’t get anything <strong>you</strong> wanted, maybe <strong>you</strong>’re not giving anything that anyone wants either.</p>
<p><strong>Why does no one care about the sweater or flashlight <strong>you</strong> gave them?</strong></p>
<p>Here’s the deal. We already have way more than we ever needed. Look around, <strong>you</strong> have everything. Your family has everything. If <strong>you</strong> didn’t have something <strong>you</strong> needed, <strong>you</strong> could go to the corner store or Target and buy it for less than $20.</p>
<p>The reality is that your <strong>holiday</strong> shopping is overlooking the one thing that <strong>everyone</strong> actually wants Santa Claus to bring for them.</p>
<p>While <strong>you</strong> were at the mall running around swiping your credit card, a small child was crying into their pillow asking for something that <strong>you</strong> never could buy them at the mall.</p>
<p><strong>What is the one thing that <strong>everyone</strong> wants for Xmas?</strong></p>
<p>Freedom.</p>
<p>One more time: <strong>the best gift anyone can get for Christmas is freedom</strong>. Why?</p>
<p>Because the #<strong>1</strong> most valuable commodity in the world is freedom. The ability to live on your own terms, doing what <strong>you</strong> want to do with your life.</p>
<p>And the fact that <strong>you</strong>’re  buying crap for people is in direct opposition of the most important  goal in everyone’s life. What is everyone’s goal? Freedom.</p>
<p>One more time, just in case <strong>you</strong> missed it: more stuff ≠ freedom.</p>
<p><strong>You</strong> know what the worst part about this whole equation is? The crap <strong>you</strong>’re buying for people is getting in the way of your own freedom too. Couldn’t <strong>you</strong> use all of that cash <strong>you</strong>’re spending on stuff for people’s closets on making your own life better? I think so.</p>
<p><strong>How to operate with a blown mind.</strong></p>
<p>I understand, <strong>you</strong>’re confused and scared. What I’m saying is blowing your mind. Has every Christmas gift <strong>you</strong>’ve given been a waste?</p>
<p>Well, no. <strong>You</strong> see, for a long time having a lot of things was a sign of wealth.  People who had money would buy fancy cars and decorate their living  rooms with all of the nicest Ikea furniture.</p>
<p>But somewhere along the way that changed. The fact is that our  generation, yours and mine, is starting to figure out that there is a  better way to display your wealth. This generation is calling themselves  a lot of things. Some operate under the moniker of Minimalist Freedom Fighters, others call this generation The New Rich.</p>
<p>Our generation is the most mobile generation ever. We live out of  backpacks, wandering the world in search of experiences. We don’t want  another set of Ultimate Scrabble or another dinky flashlight/radio,  because we already have it on our iPhone — and besides, it wouldn’t fit  into our backpack.</p>
<p>What is certain is this: the less <strong>you</strong> have the more choices <strong>you</strong> have to pursue your dreams.</p>
<p>If dreams are like fairies, every time <strong>you</strong> give a Christmas present, Tinkerbell falls out of the sky somewhere and a lost boy cries.</p>
<p><strong>So how can we fix Christmas?</strong></p>
<p>If <strong>you</strong>’ve stuck around long enough to get to this point in the blog post, I’d like to offer some resources in order to <strong>save</strong> a shit-ton of money, as well as <strong>make</strong> people want to sit next to <strong>you</strong> at the dining room table at Christmas.</p>
<p><strong><strong>1</strong>. Use your resources to help someone achieve their dreams.</strong></p>
<p>All of your friends and family are trying to achieve something (probably freedom, see above.) If <strong>you</strong> have the resources to spend tons of money on Christmas gifts, then <strong>you</strong> have the ability to re-direct those resources towards helping your  family achieve great things. Ask your little cousin what they want to  learn, and then help them pay for a class so they can learn it. Does  your cousin need more education in order to rock the opportunities the  world has to offer? Ask and see if there’s anyway <strong>you</strong> can help. Does your sister need funding to get her <a href="/minimalist-business/">minimalist business</a> off the ground? Maybe give her a few hundred bucks with no strings attached. If <strong>you</strong> don’t have any friends or family who need help, consider investing your money in <a href="http://www.kiva.org/">Kiva International</a> so that entrepreneurs in 3rd world countries can help themselves and their families this <strong>holiday</strong> season.</p>
<p><strong>2. Two inexpensive and under-appreciated gifts.</strong></p>
<p>There are two things that can <strong>make</strong> Christmas dinner better. <strong>1</strong>. Hugs, which are COMPLETELY FREE, and so infrequently given. 2. More wine. If <strong>you</strong> absolutely must buy something, use your money to get something that <strong>everyone</strong> can share and consume at Christmas dinner — then no one has to try to  figure out what the socially acceptable length of time before they can <strong>make</strong> another trip to Salvation Army is.</p>
<p><strong>3. Sometimes the best gift <strong>you</strong> can give is to yourself.</strong></p>
<p>What will <strong>make</strong> your life better? What will <strong>make</strong> <strong>you</strong> happier? I know this is a hard question to ask yourself. The answer is  almost certainly not giving useless gifts to people who don’t need them.  I bet <strong>you</strong> want to book a trip to Europe right now, don’t <strong>you</strong>? Well, do it. Or maybe <strong>you</strong> want to start a small business that pays for your life as <strong>you</strong> live and work from anywhere? Well, do it. Or maybe <strong>you</strong> want to learn something? Well, go take a freakin’ class and learn something new!</p>
<p><strong>You</strong>’ve  only got a short time on this planet, so don’t waste it being conned  into wasting your money on stupid junk by giant corporations. <strong>You</strong>’re worth more to yourself than that.</p>
<p>–</p>
<p>This post is going to go viral without your help, because it matters this <strong>holiday</strong> season.</p>
<p>But, if <strong>you</strong> liked the message and don’t want to get another flashlight for Christmas, I’d <strong>love</strong> if <strong>you</strong>’d  send this to your entire family, all of your friends, and perhaps your  neighbors too. Definitely send it to that one person in your family who  always buys <strong>you</strong> junk that <strong>you</strong> don’t need, <strong>you</strong> know who they are.</p>
